# windows-setup
The Repo to keep track of changes to my Windows Setup. 

Includes edits to Powershell, Git, and User Registry Settings.

## Installation

Run the setup script first

* **install_as_admin_setup.ps1** (should be run as Administrator)

After that you can run the scripts below to run all scripts in the **/Setup** directory for convenience.

* **install_as_admin.ps1** should be run as Administrator
* **install_as_user.ps1** 

If you would prefer to only install a subset of the scripts in this repository they can be found in the **/Setup** directory
